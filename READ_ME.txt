COrVID1920 MATLAB plotting and analysis tool

This script downloads current data from two sources - a data set collected
by the NYTimes located at:
https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
and data collected by the Covid Tracking Project located at:
https://github.com/COVID19Tracking
-or-
https://covidtracking.com/

User is prompted for download of fresh data, which will automatically be 
saved locally in .csv files, otherwise previously saved local data is used.

Data begins at 1/21/20 for NYT dataset and at 3/4/20 for Covidtracking
dataset.  Both contain county-level datasets but these data are...messy.
County-level data is downloaded and imported but not analyzed except for 
maybe a few large metro areas if I get around to it.  As of 4/1/10, all of
these online data sets appear to be updated (at least daily).

Plotting parameters are edited in the file 'InputVars.m'

Custom areas are generated by summing up the total cases for a number of 
specified states.  See 'CustomAreas.m' for how that works.

A note on geographical identifiers/geocodes:
States and counties use unique 2-digit (state) or 5-digit (county) Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes. US Divisions and Regions use 
US Census numerical identifiers.  Look-up tables with the right formatting 
are stored/accesed locally in .csv format.  See 'state-geocodes-v2017.xlsx' 
or 'state-geocodes.csv' for user reference as to how 
states/regions/divisionsare numbered.
